          About me
        </h1>
        <p>
          My name is Jarrod, and I am a fourth year computer science student at
          Arizona State University.I am pursuing an accelerated concurrent
          Master&apos;s degree in Computer Science, with a concentration in big
          data systems. I describe myself as a disciplined hard worker with the
          drive and passion to overcome any obstacle life throws at me. I&apos;m
          interested in data scientist and machine learning engineer roles, and
          am hoping to further my development as a professional in these fields.
          When I&apos;m not working or studying, you can find me hanging around
          the greater Phoenix area. My hobbies include: olympic weightlifing,
          guitar, fishing, hiking, rock climbing, and spending time with my
          friends and family.
