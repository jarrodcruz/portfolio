          About me
        </h1>
        <p>
          My name is Jarrod, and I am a third year computer science student at
          Arizona State University. I describe myself as a disciplined hard
          worker with the drive and passion to overcome any obstacle life throws
          at me. I&apos;m interested in software engineer and machine learning
          engineer roles, and am hoping to further my development as a
          professional in these fields. I aspire to pursue further education in
          Computer Science. When I&apos;m not working or studying, you can find
          me hanging around the greater Phoenix area. My hobbies include:
          weightlifing, guitar, fishing, hiking, rock climbing, and spending
          time with my friends and family.
